Phil aims to make real what is symbolized in the logo: "a triple-braided cord is not easily broken" (Ecclesiastes 4:12). Phil comes alongside the pastor and church leaders to form an interconnected three-way partnership. Their church would love to have an executive pastor, but it is too young, small, or financially-stretched to have a permanent COO-type staff leader. Phil offers churches deep and affordable management and administrative expertise as needed, complementing existing employees on special projects.

What Others Say
Phil’s contributions to the EPC have been immense. He led nearly every major project involving the operations of the Office of the General Assembly over the past six years. Among these were the relocation of the office and staff from Detroit to Orlando, conversion of the EPC’s communications and technology infrastructure systems, and restructure of our legal entities to significantly reduce exposure to risk.

Rev. Dr. Jeff Jeremiah, EPC Stated Clerk / CEO (upon Phil's retirement) 
Phil enabled me as a new pastor of a large multi-staff church to focus on my own calling and ministry because I could trust him to provide feedback and foresight into what our church was facing and would face in the years to come. He was able to identify needs before they become crises and formulate a plan with logical easy-to-follow steps for implementation.
 
Rev. Mark Kuiper, Pastor (PCA)
Former Pastor of The Kirk in St. Louis, MO
