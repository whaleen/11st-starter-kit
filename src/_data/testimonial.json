      "text": "One of the biggest needs for a church planter is handling the business aspects of birthing a church. However, it is usually one thing about which the planter knows the least.  Phil’s expertise in operations and organization is the answer to this need. Anyone planting a church that needs help on the business side of the ledger should do themselves a favor and contact Phil!  He’s been a huge help to several of our EPC church plants."

      "text": "A church’s calling is Worship, Fellowship, Discipleship, Ministry and Mission, about which pastors receive instruction in how to lead while in seminary. However, very little training is provided in how to establish a church’s infrastructure that manages these biblical functions in a God-honoring way. Therefore, Phil's ministry is very valuable to help guide church planters and pastors of existing churches in developing or improving the organizational systems that empower the church’s essential purposes."
